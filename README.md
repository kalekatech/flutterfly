## Purpose

This package is not the replacement of the current existing Flutter Material. They're meant to coexist.

It consists of a set of UI components that will reduce your development costs. Some of them are the wrappers of the current Material Widgets e.g. FlyCard where it wraps up the existing Card widget that can be aligned both vertically or horizontally with less effort as compared to the built-in one. Some of them are nonexistent e.g. Badge, Datepicker Form Field, etc. 

Additionally, we would like to showcase to our internal team about the best practices when it comes to making apps for our clients too.
