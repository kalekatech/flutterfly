# flutterfly

A collection of common widgets, extensions, utilities, as well as some other stuffs that are currently non-existent.

## Main Considerations

- Only includes the stuffs that don't exist yet, yet essentially important and is broadly re-used across our projects, hence we expect this library to be `open for extension, but closed for modification`
- Brutally **tested**

## Contents

- **Views**

  - Widget Components
    - URL Image with loading progress
    - Timeline

- **Common**

  - Extensions
    - String Extensions
  - Utils
    - Connection Utils

## Documentation

Coming Soon.

Pull requests are welcome :)
